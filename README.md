**SkySketch** is a dynamic and interactive whiteboard platform designed to enhance learning and collaboration through innovative fingertip gesture controls and AI-powered functionalities. This project focuses on delivering a seamless experience for users to annotate, manipulate, and interact with various types of content including PDFs, PowerPoint presentations, images, and 3D models. 

## Features

- **Whiteboard Interaction**: A responsive canvas that supports drawing and annotations using gestures, enabling intuitive engagement for users.
  
- **PPT & PDF Annotation**: Users can upload and annotate PDFs and PowerPoint presentations, making it an ideal tool for educational purposes, meetings, and presentations.
  
- **3D Model Handling**: Upload and manipulate 3D models directly within the platform, facilitating hands-on learning and exploration of complex concepts.
  
- **GenAI Integration**: Harnessing the power of Generative AI (GenAI) to provide context-driven support, solve math problems through drawings, and offer suggestions and enhancements based on user input.
  
- **Gesture-Based Interaction**: Hand-tracking technology enables gesture-based controls to navigate and interact with documents, images, and whiteboard elements, making the learning process more natural and engaging.
  
- **Cloud Storage Integration**: Using Firebase for storing user-specific data, such as annotations and uploads, ensuring personalized and persistent interactions.

## Technologies Used

- **React.js**: Frontend framework for building an interactive and responsive user interface.
- **Firebase**: Backend service for user authentication and storage.
- **GenAI Integration**: For AI-driven suggestions and math problem-solving.
- **Mediapipe Hands API**: For gesture and hand-tracking functionality.
- **Google Drive API**: For uploading and displaying PDFs and PowerPoint presentations.
- **Three.js**: For rendering and interacting with 3D models.
